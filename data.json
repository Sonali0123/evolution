By using positive reinforcement, goldfish can be trained to recognize and to react to light signals of different colours or to perform tricks.","They are a generalist species with varied feeding, breeding, and predator avoidance behaviors.","Reproduction: Goldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation, typically dense plants such as Cabomba or Elodea or a spawning mop. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours."]

The braincase, or neurocranium, is frequently divided into anterior and posterior sections divided by a fissure. Bony fish have no placoid scales. Mucus glands coat the body.

	 	"briefDescription": "Lizard, (suborder Sauria), any of more than 5,500 species of reptiles belonging in the order Squamata (which also includes snakes, suborder Serpentes). Lizards are scaly-skinned reptiles that are usually distinguished from snakes by the possession of legs, movable eyelids, and external ear openings. However, some traditional (that is, non-snake) lizards lack one or more of these features. For example, limb degeneration and loss has occurred in glass lizards (Ophisaurus) and other lizard groups. Movable eyelids have been lost in some geckos, skinks, and night lizards. External ear openings have disappeared in some species in the genera Holbrookia and Cophosaurus. Most of the living species of lizards inhabit warm regions, but some are found near the Arctic Circle in Eurasia and others range to the southern tip of South America.",

They are now thought to have engaged more in pushing or wrestling behavior with their horns, and broken rib bones on some specimens seem to indicate that they may have attacked each other from the side."]
